# RenderEase - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Open the Application

**Easiest Method:**
- Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser

**Alternative (Recommended for best performance):**
```bash
# In the project directory, run:
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then open in browser:
# http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Try the Demo

1. Click on one of the "Sample Room" buttons (Room 1, 2, or 3)
2. Click and drag on the floor area to select it
3. Click on any texture from the library (try "Wood Floor" or "Carpet Gray")
4. Click "Apply Texture" button
5. See the magic happen! ‚ú®

### 3. Use Your Own Images

1. Click "Choose Image" and upload a photo of your room
2. Select the surface you want to change (floor, wall, etc.)
3. Choose a texture or upload your own
4. Adjust opacity and brightness to match your room's lighting
5. Click "Apply Texture"
6. Click "Save Result" to download your visualization

## üé® Tips for Best Results

### Taking Room Photos
- Use good lighting
- Take photos straight-on for walls and floors
- Avoid extreme angles
- Higher resolution = better results

### Selecting Surfaces
- Click and drag to create a selection box
- Try to select the entire surface area
- Avoid including furniture or objects
- Larger selections work better

### Applying Textures
- Start with 80% opacity
- Use "Multiply" blend mode for floors
- Use "Overlay" for walls
- Adjust brightness to match room lighting
- Enable "Perspective Correction" for realism

### Blend Modes Explained
- **Normal:** Direct overlay (best for first try)
- **Multiply:** Darkens (great for floors)
- **Overlay:** Preserves highlights and shadows (best for walls)
- **Soft Light:** Subtle effect (good for subtle changes)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Image Won't Load
- Ensure image is in JPG or PNG format
- Check file size (< 10MB recommended)
- Try refreshing the page

### Selection Not Working
- Make sure an image is loaded first
- Click and hold, then drag
- Selection must be at least 10x10 pixels

### Texture Looks Wrong
- Try different blend modes
- Adjust opacity (lower = more subtle)
- Adjust brightness to match room
- Try a different texture

### Can't See Changes
- Make sure you selected a surface area
- Make sure you selected a texture
- Check if opacity is too low
- Try clicking "Reset" and starting over
