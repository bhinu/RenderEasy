Based on your feedback about needing better object segmentation, we've added **state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms** that precisely isolate objects before applying textures.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **GrabCut Segmentation** ⭐ Recommended

Interactive foreground/background segmentation that learns from a rough bounding box.

**Perfect for:**
- Floors with furniture
- Walls with decorations
- Complex scenes

**Accuracy:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

```python
POST /api/advanced-segment
{
  "method": "grabcut",
  "params": {
    "rect": [x, y, width, height],
    "iterations": 5
  }
}
```

### 2. **Region Growing**

Grows a region from a seed point based on color similarity.

**Perfect for:**
- Uniform colored surfaces
- Quick selections

**Speed:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡

### 3. **Smart Flood Fill**

Advanced flood fill with edge-aware stopping.

**Perfect for:**
- Solid colors
- Fastest method

**Speed:** ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡

### 4. **Multi-Scale Segmentation**

Segments at multiple resolutions and combines for maximum accuracy.

**Perfect for:**
- Complex textures
- Maximum quality

**Accuracy:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### 5. **Mask-Based Texture Application**

New endpoint that applies textures using precise masks with feathering.

```python
POST /api/apply-texture-with-mask
{
  "mask": "...",        # From segmentation
  "feather": 8,         # Soft edges
  "blend_alpha": 0.85
}
```

## 📊 Comparison: Old vs New

### Old Method (Rectangular Selection):
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  ███████████   │  Problem: Texture applies to
│  █Floor████    │  EVERYTHING in rectangle,
│  ████Table█    │  including table!
│  ███████████   │
└─────────────────┘
```

### New Method (GrabCut Segmentation):
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  ███████████   │  Solution: Texture applies
│  █Floor████    │  ONLY to floor,
│  ....Table.    │  table is preserved!
│  ███████████   │
└─────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Segment the Surface:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/advanced-segment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "image": "base64_data",
       "method": "grabcut",
       "params": {"rect": [50, 400, 700, 200]}
     }'
   ```

2. **Apply Texture with Mask:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/apply-texture-with-mask \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "image": "base64_data",
       "texture": "base64_texture",
       "mask": "base64_mask",
       "feather": 8
     }'
   ```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Living Room Floor
**Problem:** Floor has couch and coffee table

**Solution:**
1. Use GrabCut with rectangle around floor
2. Algorithm automatically excludes furniture
3. Apply wood texture only to floor
4. Result: Professional quality!

### Use Case 2: Bedroom Wall
**Problem:** Wall has bed frame and art

**Solution:**
1. Use Region Growing, click on wall
2. Algorithm stops at edges
3. Apply paint/wallpaper to wall only
4. Result: Realistic visualization!

### Use Case 3: Kitchen Counter
**Problem:** Counter has appliances and items

**Solution:**
1. Use Smart Flood Fill on counter
2. Fast segmentation of counter top
3. Apply granite/marble texture
4. Result: Quick preview for client!

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### For Maximum Accuracy:
1. Use **GrabCut** with 7-10 iterations
2. Draw bounding box tight around object
3. Use **Multi-Scale** for final output
4. Set feather to 8-10 pixels

### For Speed:
1. Use **Flood Fill** or **Region Growing**
2. Lower GrabCut iterations to 3
3. Skip Multi-Scale
4. Resize large images first

### For Natural Blending:
1. Always use feathering (5-10 pixels)
2. Match brightness to room lighting
3. Use Multiply blend for floors
4. Use Overlay blend for walls

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current:
- No interactive refinement UI (coming in v2.2)
- Single object segmentation (multi-object coming)
- No mask editing tools (coming soon)
- No SAM integration yet (planned)

### Workarounds:
- For multiple objects: Segment one at a time
- For refinement: Adjust parameters and re-segment
- For complex cases: Use Multi-Scale method
